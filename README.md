In this project, we focused on movie data from The Movie Database to answer the question: What factors lead to movie success, where success is defined by the average vote rating?

The jupyter notebook file, EDA.ipynb, contains the exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling (and machine learning) that we performed to gain our insights.
